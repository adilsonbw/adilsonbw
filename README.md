- 👋 Hi, I’m @adilsonbw
- 👀 I'm interested in Physics, Mathematics, Programming, Politics, Arts, Nature and Technologies in general, not necessarily in that order :smiley:.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to create a web page to promote my work and adapt my codes to leave it on github.
- 💞️ I try to collaborate in my research group and at the same time get to know other areas.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
